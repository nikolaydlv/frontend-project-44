# Mind Games Project

Mind Games is a set of five console games based on popular mobile brain training apps. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered to be completed. Wrong answers end the game and offer to play it again. Games:

• Brain-even - you need to determine the number for parity.

• Brain-calc - you need to calculate a pair of numbers.

• Brain-gcd - you need to calculate and output the greatest common divisor of these numbers.

• Brain-prime - you need to determine a prime number or not a prime number.

• Brain-progression - you need to identify the hidden number.

### Installation:
